### Stack and Queue Functions
The stack and queue functions showcase the implementation of stack and queue data structures using Python lists. These structures simulate the behavior similar to  a stack of books and a queue of people, respectively.

### DataFrame and Vowels Counting
The second script employs the pandas library to create a DataFrame of movie titles and release years. Additionally, it introduces a function count_vowels to count the vowels in each movie title. The result is visualized by adding a new 'Vowels' column to the DataFrame.

### Streamlit App
The third script is a Streamlit app that allows users to upload a CSV file and visualizes the data, specifically focusing on the 'age' column by generating a histogram. This script provides a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze data.
